# WeSplit

### Hacking with SwiftUI - Project 1

WeSplit is part of the Hacking with SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson.

Is a very simple app made to learn the basics of SwiftUI, pickers, forms and sections. It allows the user to enter the amount of a bill and split it between the selected number of people, with an option to add a tip.
